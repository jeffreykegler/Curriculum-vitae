          <p>Marpa::R2 is the latest CPAN release of the Perl version of
            the Marpa parsing algorithm and its upper layers.
            Marpa is an efficient general BNF parser,
            based on Aycock and Horspool's
            and Joop Leo's modifications
            of the Earley algorithm.
            Marpa::R2 has seen widespread use.
