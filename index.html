          <h2>Marpa::R2<span>2012 to present</span></h2>
          <p>Marpa::R2 is the latest CPAN release of the Perl version of
            the Marpa algorithm and its upper layers.
            Its predecessor
            Marpa::XS, was recognized as one of Perl's most important modules
            within weeks of its 1.0 release in December 2011, and
          </p><ul>
            <li>was pre-announced by National Public Radio's ``NPR Tech Team'' on their
              news feed (19 Nov 2011);</li>
            <li>
              was cited by the Perl Foundation as evidence that
              ``Perl is bigger and better than ever''
              (Perl Foundation News, 5 January 2012).</li>
          </ul>
          <ul></ul>
          By its 6-month anniversary, Marpa::XS
          <ul>
            <li>was a Fedora package (as of release 16);</li>
            <li>had received its first academic citation
              (DOI: 10.4230/OASIcs.SLATE.2012.41); and</li>
            <li>
              was mentioned in the Perl language's
              own documentation (perlfaq4 as of 5.16.0).</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Marpa::R2, the version of the Marpa algorithm under active
            development is available on
            <a href="https://metacpan.org/release/Marpa-R2">
              CPAN</a>
            and
            <a href="https://github.com/jeffreykegler/Marpa--R2">Github</a>.
            Heavily refactored,
            it cleanly separates its Perl upper layers
            from the core Marpa algorithm, which has
            become the Libmarpa C library.
          </p><h2>Libmarpa<span>2012 to present</span></h2>

              Libmarpa</a>
            is
            the library implementing the core of the Marpa algorithm,
            written in CWEB, Don Knuth's "literate programming" version of
            the C language.
